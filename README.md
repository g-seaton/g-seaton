## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m currently a sophomore studying Data Science and Supply Chain Operations at Washington University in St. Louis!

I love skateboarding, nature, anime, and traveling!

Always hoping to learn and expand my technical expertise.

Fun fact: I was a Junior Olympic hurdler and long jumper.
